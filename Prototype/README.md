\# Current Prototype

Hardware was passed out the week of November 3rd 2025, so real progress can be made now.  



Included in this folder is the breadboard prototype as of 11-5-2025.  



Above is the screen connected to one of the dev boards in the same family as the final chip, but a different sub SKU. Running on the board is the LCD test example code found here: https://github.com/RobertoBenjami/stm32\_hal\_graphics\_display\_drivers  



It currently doesn't display correctly, but the noise on the display implies that the communication is half working. We will currently be working on debugging the project above and implement portions into our final program.  



We will also be working on the IFFT in order to convert bit maps into waveforms, ideally the same way as spectrograms are produced and interpreted.
